    I just started swimming this year from May 2025. I love swimming and I am really good at it. Each Saturday we have a swim meet from 9 to 12 and I go to it. I popped my time by 2 seconds in 2 strokes last swim meet and mom was proud of me.

    Also this week, I have Robotics Camp at a place called California High School. It starts from 9 to 12 and I go to it. It is super fun because you get to build robots, play against other teams, enter tournaments, and create 3D figures using a 3D printer. On Friday, you get medals and prizes like candy.

  <p>
    Next week, I have an event called Vacation Bible School at St Joan of Arc. It's fun because you get to be split into groups, do fun activities, eat food, and at the end of Friday, we get popsicles.

    Also this week I have started a new basketball program called Just Respect Basketball at a place called Fallon Middle School. My coach's name is Coach Jimpee. It happens every week on Monday and Wednesday. It starts from 5 to 6:30. I had fun playing basketball because we got to run, do drills like plays, and play a game. In the end of practice, dad was so proud of me and we went home. The experience was great because I got to meet new friends and play basketball.

    Last, before the first day of school, weâ€™re going to Newport for vacation. But before that, we get to go on a 3-day trip to a place called Catalina Islands from Long Beach. After that, we go to Newport. We get to do lots of fun stuff.
